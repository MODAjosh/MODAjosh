👋 Hi, I’m @MODAjosh  
I’m the lead instructor at Missouri Drone Academy (MDA), where we prepare students for careers in drone piloting, geospatial analysis, and GIS.  

👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of drone technology, geospatial data, and architectural preservation. I’m passionate about leveraging drones for education and advancing our understanding of architectural heritage through precise data collection and analysis.  

🌱 I’m currently learning about advanced GIS tools like Blender GIS and how to turn data from drones like the Matrice 350 RTK into presentable models for educational purposes.  

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving drone surveying, LiDAR data processing, GIS, and architectural history. If you’re interested in educational collaboration or new tech applications in geospatial sciences, let’s connect!  

📫 How to reach me:  
Feel free to reach out via GitHub or email at Josh@Cpsemo.org. You can also follow our work at Missouri Drone Academy on social media platforms.  

😄 Pronouns: He/Him  

⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not teaching drone tech or geospatial analysis, I’m diving into historical architecture and documenting its significance—one building at a time!
